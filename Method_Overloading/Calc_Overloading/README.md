# Java Calculator – Method Overloading Example Program

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates **method overloading** using a simple **calculator** example.

The program shows how the same method name can perform different operations based on **parameter count and data types**.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program defines multiple `add()` methods with different parameter lists and calls them from the `main` method to perform addition operations.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Creates an object of the `Calculator` class
- Calls overloaded `add()` methods to:
  - Add two integers
  - Add three integers
  - Add two double values
- Returns and prints the result of each operation

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Method Overloading  
- Compile-time Polymorphism  
- Method signature variation  
- Static methods  
- Return types  
- Console output using `System.out.println()`  

---

## 🖥️ Output

## 📂 File Information

- `Calculator.java` — Java source code  
- `output.png` — Screenshot of the program output  
- `README.md` — Project documentation  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only addition operation is supported
- Inputs are hardcoded
- No user input handling
- No error handling for invalid data types
