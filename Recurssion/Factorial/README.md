# Java Factorial – Recursion Example Program

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates how to **calculate the factorial of a number using recursion**.

The example is intended for **beginners** to understand recursive function calls and base conditions.

---

## 📌 Program Overview

The program calculates the factorial of a number using the mathematical definition:

- `n! = n × (n − 1)!`
- Base condition: `1! = 1`

The recursive method repeatedly calls itself until the base condition is met.

---

## 🧪 Code Functionality

- Calls the `factorial()` method from the `main` method
- Uses recursion to calculate factorial
- Defines a base condition to stop infinite recursion
- Multiplies the current number with the factorial of the previous number
- Prints the final factorial result to the console

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Recursion in Java  
- Method calling itself  
- Base condition in recursion  
- Stack-based execution  
- Mathematical factorial logic  
- Console output using `System.out.println()`

## 📂 File Information

- `Factorial.java` — Java source code  
- `output.png` — Screenshot of the program output  
- `README.md` — Project documentation  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Factorial value is hardcoded
- Works only for positive integers greater than 0
- No input validation
- May cause stack overflow for large numbers
